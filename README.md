# Summary: 

The drawback to this new design is that the user has to type in correctly for the filter to work.   In addition to the difficult filters, the story at the top takes up a lot of space.   The user might not be aware that the filter search is farther down. 

To continue to refine the process, the following recommendations are suggested:

-Improve filters:  This could be corrected by included a drop down for the user to select the values to filter on.   This way there is no mistake and the information is returned correctly.

- Data:   currently the data is limited to the information provided.    A way to improve this would be to develop an system using splinter, beautiful soup, Flask and a database to constatly look and update the informaiton.

- Images:  To even further the users experience, the website should include more pictures of the filtered information.
